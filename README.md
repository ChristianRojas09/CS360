# Repo for SNHU CS-360 Event Tracking android application

### **Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

This application was designed to take information about an event and store that information in a database. Event information is also to be displayed on the main screen for the user to view.

### **What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

Three main screens are used: 
  * The login screen: where the user inputs their credentials to view their persistent data. 
  * The main activity screen: this is where the event data is displayed for the user to view
  * the event creation screen: this screen took user input regarding the event and saved it to the database.

### **How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**

I approached this app by following the SDLC. I used the information and requirements provided to me and designed the UI around the user's needs. Once the UI was designed and I understood the requirements I began building the app.
During development, I was persistent at testing often to ensure that new features were working, and not interfering with functions that it shouldn't. 

### **How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?**

I was able to ensure the code was functional by testing it through the emulator and Logcat. Using Logcat I was able to see any problems that the app would run into during runtime - even problems I could not see in the code editor.
It is important to test the functionality of the code to ensure it will operate as expected in the users' hands.

### **Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**

My app looks _nothing_ like my original design. Throughout development, there were many iterations of the app that were too convoluted as I had overcomplicated the code, so with each iteration I was able to create more efficient code. 
An app with many functions must be well organized, this project taught me much about that.

### **In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**

I was very happy with how the SQLite database worked out. I have never worked with a database like this in android or java. It took some intense studying, but after it all the database works well. It is not perfect though, there are many improvements I still need to implement, like storing more event information and creating new tables.
